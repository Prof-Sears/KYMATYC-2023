Solve the equation 8q – 5 = 5q - 20.
I’m going to represent the equation with poker chips.
Positive terms are above the line.
Negative terms are below.
Combine the q terms by subtracting 5q from each side.
Matching terms above and below the line add out.
Next, combine the constant terms by adding 5 to both sides.
Again, matching terms add out.
Finally, stack the chips in piles of three.
The solution is q = -5.
